**Java Event Processing Playbook**

**Introduction:**

This playbook outlines procedures for managing our Java application that accepts events, caches them, and sends them to Kafka.

**Monitoring & Alerts:**

* Track application health (CPU, memory)
* Monitor event processing rates (accepted, cached, produced)
* Watch cache size, hit rate, and eviction rate
* Monitor Kafka producer success/failure and message backlog

**Alerts will be triggered for:**

* Application errors or crashes
* Significant processing rate changes
* Cache performance issues
* Kafka producer failures or large backlogs

**Incident Response:**

**Tier 1:**

1. Check application logs for errors.
2. Verify cache and Kafka health.
3. Restart the application (if necessary).

**Tier 2:**

1. Analyze logs for root cause.
2. Investigate cache performance issues.
3. Check Kafka producer configuration and connectivity.

**Tier 3:**

1. Engage developers for code analysis (if needed).
2. Coordinate with cache/Kafka admins (if necessary).

**Runbooks:**

* Detailed instructions for restarting the application are in the "Restart_Application.txt" file.
* Similar instructions exist for other actions (refer to separate files).

**Automation:**

* Application restarts can be automated based on alerts (to be implemented).

**Continuous Improvement:**

* Regularly review playbooks and incident logs.
* Update playbooks based on lessons learned.
* Conduct post-incident reviews to improve automation and prevention.
