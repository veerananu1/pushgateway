Explanation of Key Methods:

validate(PhoneForensicsValidation validation) (continued):

Logs a debug message to indicate the start of validation.
Initiates an asynchronous operation (CompletableFuture) to get the member's phone numbers from the contactPointsService using getPhones(validation.getMemberGuid()).
Calls getCallsDataFromCache(validation) to attempt retrieving cached data for the user.
If no cached data is found:
Sets the validation status to "NOT_AVAILABLE" and logs a message.
If the CallsResponse object is missing required fields (countryCode or callingNumberAni):
Sets the validation status to "NOT_AVAILABLE" and logs a message.
Otherwise:
Extracts the relevant data from the CallsResponse object and maps it into the validation object using a lambda expression.
Logs a warning if the CallsState is unknown.
Checks if the CallsState is green or if the trust indicator exceeds a threshold (clientConfig.getTrustThreshold()):
If so, fetches core customer data using the CompletableFuture object and determines if the phone number is on file.
Handles exceptions from the core customer call.
Sets the validation status, trust indicator, and trust threshold values in the validation object and logs information.
Returns the updated PhoneForensicsValidation object.
getCallsDataFromCache(PhoneForensicsValidation validation):

Logs a debug message to indicate cache retrieval.
Sets up a Retry object to attempt retrieving data from the cache up to 4 times with a 150ms wait between retries. This handles cases where the cache might be temporarily empty.
Uses the getEventPublisher.onRetryEvent method (likely for logging or handling retry events).
Attempts to retrieve the TrustidAuthLogEntity object from the cache using the `callsCache

I didn't understand these part:

If no cached data is found:
Sets the validation status to "NOT_AVAILABLE" and logs a message.
If the CallsResponse object is missing required fields (countryCode or callingNumberAni):
Sets the validation status to "NOT_AVAILABLE" and logs a message.
Otherwise:
Extracts the relevant data from the CallsResponse object and maps it into the validation object using a lambda expression.
Logs a warning if the CallsState is unknown.
Checks if the CallsState is green or if the trust indicator exceeds a threshold (clientConfig.getTrustThreshold()):
If so, fetches core customer data using the CompletableFuture object and determines if the phone number is on file.
Handles exceptions from the core customer call.
Sets the validation status, trust indicator, and trust threshold values in the validation object and logs information.
Returns the updated PhoneForensicsValidation object.
Here's a breakdown of the specific parts you mentioned, focusing on clarity and conciseness:

1. Handling Missing Cached Data:

The code checks if any data is retrieved from the cache using getCallsDataFromCache(validation).
If no data is found:
It sets the validation object's status to "NOT_AVAILABLE," indicating the absence of information from the cache.
It logs a message, likely for debugging or informational purposes, stating that no data was found.
2. Handling Missing Required Fields:

The code checks if the retrieved CallsResponse object (containing call data) has two essential fields:
countryCode: The country code associated with the phone number.
callingNumberAni: The calling phone number.
If either field is missing:
It sets the validation object's status to "NOT_AVAILABLE," indicating invalid or incomplete data.
It logs a message, likely stating that required fields are missing in the response.
3. Processing Valid Cached Data:

If the call data is valid (has required fields):
The code extracts relevant information from the CallsResponse object.
It uses a lambda expression (a concise way to write a small anonymous function) to map this extracted data into the validation object, updating it with the call details.
If the CallsState (a field indicating the call's validity) is unknown, it logs a warning.
4. Checking Trustworthiness:

The code checks two factors to assess the call's trustworthiness:
CallsState: If it's green (likely valid), or
Trust Indicator: If it exceeds a threshold defined in the clientConfig.getTrustThreshold() method (likely indicating a higher level of trust).
If either condition is met:
It uses the previously obtained CompletableFuture object (representing asynchronous retrieval of core customer data) to get the user's phone numbers.
It further checks if those phone numbers match the calling number.
In case of any exceptions during core customer data retrieval, it handles them appropriately (e.g., logging errors).
5. Returning the Validation Result:

Finally, the code sets the final validation status, trust indicator, and trust threshold values in the validation object.
It logs information about the validation outcome.
The updated PhoneForensicsValidation object is returned, containing the combined results of cache check, call data analysis, and (potentially) core customer data comparison.
I hope this explanation provides a clearer understanding of these specific code segments!

when it use core customer data
The code uses core customer data only when certain conditions are met:

Valid call data (with country code and calling number) is found in the cache.
Either the call state is "green" (likely valid) or the trust indicator exceeds a threshold.
In this situation, the code performs the following actions:

It uses a CompletableFuture object to asynchronously retrieve core customer data, likely containing phone numbers associated with the user.
It then checks if the retrieved phone numbers from the core customer system match the calling number from the call data.
This comparison helps to determine if the caller is a legitimate customer. Matching phone numbers might indicate a higher level of trust in the call's validity.

Key points to remember:

Core customer data is not accessed in every validation instance. It's only used when specific criteria from the call data suggest further verification might be needed.
The code likely retrieves core customer data securely and handles potential exceptions gracefully.
I hope this clarifies the specific scenario where core customer data is used in the code.

how to setup an slo for  operation all that operation done when they are calling /validation
Here's how you can set up an SLO (Service Level Objective) for the /validation operation in the code you provided:

1. Define Metrics:

Identify relevant metrics that capture the performance/success of the /validation operation. These could be:
Latency: Average time taken to complete a /validation request.
Error Rate: Percentage of /validation requests that result in errors (e.g., HTTP status codes outside the 2xx range).
Success Rate: Percentage of /validation requests that complete successfully.
Cache Hit Rate: Percentage of /validation requests served from the cache.
2. Set Targets:

Determine acceptable values for each metric based on user experience, business requirements, and resource constraints. For example:
Latency target: Less than 200 milliseconds (ms).
Error rate target: Less than 1%.
Success rate target: 99.9%.
Cache hit rate target: 80%.
3. Establish Error Budget:

Allocate a total error budget, representing the acceptable amount of deviation from the defined targets. This budget can be divided across various metrics based on their relative importance.
For example, you could allocate 50% of the budget to the error rate and 25% each to latency and success rate.
4. Implement Monitoring and Alerting:

Set up monitoring tools to capture the chosen metrics continuously.
Configure alerts to notify relevant teams when any metric falls below its target or exceeds its allocated portion of the error budget. This enables timely intervention and troubleshooting.
5. Track and Review:

Regularly monitor the performance of the /validation operation through dashboards, reports, and alerts.
Analyze trends and identify areas for improvement.
Review and adjust SLO targets and error budgets periodically based on user feedback, business needs, and system performance data.
Additional Considerations:

Timeframe: Define the timeframe (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) over which the SLO applies.
Seasonality: Account for potential seasonal fluctuations in traffic when setting targets and error budgets.
Monitoring granularity: Break down your metrics by relevant dimensions (e.g., user type, device type) for deeper insights.
Remember, setting up an effective SLO involves a continuous process of defining, monitoring, and improving the performance of your service. By following these steps and continuously refining your approach, you can ensure a reliable and high-quality experience for users of the /validation operation.




Here's a simplified explanation of how to set up an SLO for the /validation operation:

1. What is an SLO?

Think of it as a promise you make to your users about the performance of the /validation operation. It defines what you want to achieve and how well you expect the system to perform.

2. Steps to Set Up an SLO:

Pick the right metrics: These are measurements that tell you how well the /validation operation is doing. Examples include:
How long it takes to complete a request (latency)
How often it fails (error rate)
How often it succeeds (success rate)
Set goals for each metric: This is what you want to achieve. Aim for realistic targets that balance user experience and system capabilities. For example, a latency goal could be under 2 seconds.
Allocate an error budget: This is like a "spending limit" for how much you can deviate from your goals. Imagine having points for meeting your targets and losing points when you fall below them.
Monitor and alert: Track how the operation performs over time and get notified when things go wrong. This helps you fix problems quickly and stay on track.
Review and improve: Regularly check how well you're meeting your SLO and adjust your goals and budgets if needed. This is an ongoing process to keep your system performing its best.
3. Remember:

This is a guide, you'll need to customize it for your specific needs and context.
Consider factors like user expectations, system capabilities, and overall business goals.
Setting up an SLO is an ongoing process, so be prepared to adapt and improve over time.
By following these steps and thinking about your users' needs, you can create a meaningful SLO for the /validation operation and ensure it meets expectations.


Here's a breakdown of the process in plain language:

1. Checking for Cached Data:

The code first looks for previously stored information ("cached data") that might be relevant.
If no cached data is found, it sets the validation status to "NOT_AVAILABLE" and makes a note of it in the logs.
2. Examining Response Data:

If there's cached data, it examines a specific object called CallsResponse.
If this object is missing crucial fields like countryCode or callingNumberAni, it again sets the validation status to "NOT_AVAILABLE" and logs a message.
3. Processing Valid Data:

If the CallsResponse has the necessary fields, the code extracts the relevant information from it.
It transfers this information into a separate object called validation using a concise coding technique (a lambda expression).
It logs a warning if the CallsState (which is likely a status indicator for calls) is unknown.
4. Making a Decision:

The code checks if the CallsState is "green" or if a "trust indicator" is above a certain level (defined as clientConfig.getTrustThreshold()).
If either of these conditions is met, it calls another function to get additional customer data.
5. Fetching Core Customer Data:

If extra customer data is needed, it's fetched using a specific tool called CompletableFuture.
The code determines whether the phone number they're investigating is registered in this customer data.
Any errors that occur during this retrieval are handled appropriately.
6. Updating Validation Object:

The code updates the validation object with:
The final validation status
The trust indicator value
The trust threshold value
It also logs information about these values for later reference.
7. Returning Result:

Finally, the updated PhoneForensicsValidation object, containing all the gathered information, is sent back as the result of this process.
