The FlushGateway application checks the last push value for each group of metrics. If the last push value is greater than 5 minutes, indicating no metric has been pushed in that timeframe, the corresponding metric group is deleted. This check occurs every 30 seconds.

When deleting a metric group, the job label needs to be specified before deleting. If any label value is not sent (e.g., instance=""), it should be appended to the end of the URL.

To add a new PushGateway URL:

Access OpenShift and navigate to the desired namespace.
Go to the networking section and select the service related to your application.
Copy the service name (until "svc") and append the port number to it.
Add the new URL to the environment file, separating it with commas.
