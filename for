Based on your application description, here's a breakdown of the recommended SLOs for each part:

1. API endpoint (/event):

Latency SLO: Aim for a low average response time for handling the POST request. This directly impacts user experience and should be aligned with your expectations for responsiveness.
Success Rate SLO: Aim for a high success rate for processing the request without errors. This ensures data integrity and prevents potential data loss.
2. Kafka Producer:

Success Rate SLO: Aim for a high success rate for successfully publishing events to the Kafka topic. This ensures data reaches the intended destination without loss.
Latency SLO (optional): You can consider an SLO for the time taken to publish events, especially if it impacts downstream consumers. However, prioritize the overall success rate first.
3. Cache:

Hit Rate SLO: Aim for a high cache hit rate to improve performance by serving data from the cache whenever possible. This reduces load on the backend and improves responsiveness.
Prioritization:

While all SLOs are important, prioritize based on their impact on user experience and business needs. Typically, API endpoint success rate and latency are crucial for user experience and should be prioritized. Kafka producer success rate is essential for data integrity, while cache hit rate improves performance but might be less critical depending on the application's nature.

Remember, these are just recommendations. You should adjust the specific SLO targets and their relative importance based on your specific application's requirements and user expectations.



Here's a simplified breakdown of where to set SLOs in your application:

Focus on:

API endpoint (/event):
Success rate: Ensure requests are processed successfully to avoid data loss.
Latency: Aim for fast response times to provide a good user experience.
Also consider:

Kafka producer:
Success rate: Ensure events are published to Kafka without errors.
Optional:

Cache:
Hit rate: Strive for a high hit rate to improve performance.
Remember:

Prioritize based on impact: Focus on SLOs that directly affect user experience and data integrity.
Adjust based on needs: Adapt these recommendations to your specific application's requirements.
Monitor and improve: Continuously monitor SLOs and make adjustments as needed.
By following these guidelines, you can effectively set up SLOs to ensure your custom application meets your expectations for reliability and performance.
